The program implements the Strategy design pattern. It defines a family of algorithms (EmployeeRoles) and encapsulates each one of them. It also provides a context class (EmployeePay) that allows clients to switch between these algorithms dynamically by changing the EmployeeRole object that it holds.

The EmployeeRole interface defines the common behaviour for all the concrete classes that implement it, which is to calculate the salary, bonus, and hike for a particular employee.

The concrete classes (Attendant, Manager, Supervisor, and Worker) implement the EmployeeRole interface and provide specific implementations of the calculateSalary(), calculateBonus(), and calculateHike() methods.

The context class (EmployeePay) takes in the employee's name, base salary, and an EmployeeRole object, and stores them as instance variables. It also has an ArrayList to store the pay details calculated by the executeStrategy() method, which calls the calculateSalary(), calculateBonus(), and calculateHike() methods of the EmployeeRole object to get the pay details.

Overall, this program allows the calculation of an employee's pay details by dynamically switching between different EmployeeRoles, which can be helpful in a real-world scenario where an employee's pay grade or role might change over time.
